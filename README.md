# CameraCalibration-Photomosaicing-Panorama
This repository contains MATLAB code files that demonstrate the implementation of a camera calibration toolbox for reprojection error and image set undistortion, as well as a MATLAB script implementing a Harris Feature detector for photomosaicing and panorama generation. The code utilizes the Caltech MATLAB GUI-based Camera Calibration toolbox for accurate camera calibration and distortion correction. Additionally, the script incorporates the Harris Feature detector algorithm to detect and match key features in a set of images, enabling the creation of stunning photomosaics and panoramic images.
